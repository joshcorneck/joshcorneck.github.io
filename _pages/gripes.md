Here I keep a running list of gripes.

## Gripes thematically but in no particular order of gripey-ness

### General
- Adverts on a streaming platform that I already pay an extortionate amount of money to access. 
- Supermarkets charging 40p for <i> paper</i> carrier bags?
- People not pressing the button to cross the street and standing there like a melon.
- Companies charging extra on an item and saying it will go to charity - why don't you just donate some of the money from the normal price rather than getting me to cover it?
- Coffee shops charging the price of a bottle of oat milk to make my coffee with a splash of oat milk.
- Piers Morgan.
- People who call going to the gym "training" (unless you actually are training for an event). 

### Public transport
- Clapham Common station in the morning Monday-Thursday.
- The announcer on the platform at Clapham Common station.
- The Chief Officers of TFL.
- People who lean on the handrail on the tube so that nobody else can hold it.
- People who have loudspeaker conversations.
- People who watch videos with no headphones.

### Huxley building
- The toilets on 6M.
- The toilets on 6.
- The toilets on 5.
