I am a final-year PhD student at Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, funded through the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Statistics and Machine Learning (StatML CDT).

My research focuses on the statistical analysis of dynamic network-valued data, with a particular emphasis on network point processes. I develop methodology and supporting theory for clustering and community detection under a range of modelling assumptions, with an emphasis on scalable inference and rigorous guarantees. I have applied this work to diverse settings, including bike-sharing networks, global food trade networks, and air-traffic data. More recently, I have collaborated on a project developing a framework for simulating ultra-long EEG seizure time series using Gaussian processes and a Conv-LSTM VAE, with the goal of supporting data augmentation for machine learning methods in seizure detection.

Please reach out if you’re interested in any of these topics or would like to discuss potential collaborations.
